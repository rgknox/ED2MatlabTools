HELLO!
IMAGINE ME SCREAMING THIS WITH UTTER ENTHUSIASM!!
FREE DATA TO TEST THESE SCRIPTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED HERE:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_5e7rc3QoQqV3VnaTJabVJrX2s/view?usp=sharing

DOWNLOAD THE DATA INTO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THIS README

Now imagine me saying this in a normal, inside, non-exuberant voice.
After downloading, un-tar the file:
tar -xzvf matlabtools_testdata.tgz

Once you have the data un-tarred, you should be able to test the driver scripts.

The scripts in Functions/ are just support scripts and should not be invoked directly.
