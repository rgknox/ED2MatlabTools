HELLO!
IMAGINE ME SCREAMING THIS WITH UTTER ENTHUSIASM!!
FREE DATA TO TEST THESE SCRIPTS CAN BE DOWNLOADED HERE:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_5e7rc3QoQqV3VnaTJabVJrX2s/view?usp=sharing

DOWNLOAD THE DATA INTO THE DIRECTORY CONTAINING THIS README

Now imagine me saying this in a normal, inside, non-exuberant voice.
After downloading, un-tar the file:
tar -xzvf matlabtools_testdata.tgz

Once you have the data un-tarred, you should be able to test the driver scripts.

The scripts in Functions/ are just support scripts and should not be invoked directly.

Request: If you find these scripts useful, and they are used to publish research, please use your best judgement in deciding to include Ryan Knox as an author. If these scripts are used as just a basis, or a mechanism to understand how to process ED2 output, please acknowledge these scripts in your "Acknowledgements" section of your manuscript.
